#### Intuitive Annuity Calculator tool for insurance agents that is easy to use.

An insurance company sells annuities to individuals age 40+.
The maximum age that the insurance company offers payments to is age 110. Annuitants receive payments once per year.

There are 5 possible annuities that the annuitant could purchase:

Plan # 1: $15,000 per year; annuitant decides what age payments will start at and how long they’ll go for.

Plan # 2: Payments start at age 65 and go to age 94; initial payment is $25,000 and payments increase by $1000 per year.

Plan # 3: Annuitant decides when payments start, and they go to age 110; $7,200 per year.

Plan # 4: Payments start at age 60 and go to age 100. Each year, the annuitant gets 1000 per year they’ve been alive. For example, at age 64 the annuitant would get $64,000; the following year when they’re 65, they’d get $65,000.

Plan # 5: Annuitant decides what age payments start and end at. The first half of the payments is $19,000. The second half of the payments is $25,000. For example, if the annuitant got 4 years of payments, the first two would be for $19,000 and the second two would be for $25,000.

## Part # 1
Your job is to create an annuity illustration tool that will allow insurance agents to quickly and easily illustrate the annuity payments that an annuitant can expect each year from now until the last annuity payment.

Remember, this illustration tool needs to be intuitive for the insurance agents and easy to use. It should look professional.

The insurance agent should be able to input a specific plan number (specified above), as well as any other necessary information and then have an easily understood illustration of what annuity payments the annuitant should expect each year in the future.

Your illustration tool should also provide the following pieces of information: Total Payments (a total of all payments made), Total Years of Payments, and the Age of the Last Payment.

Make sure you complete part # 1 before you move forward.
